# Prithvi Raj Nair | Product Manager and Engineer

**Building with AI | Bridging Product Thinking with a Passion for Emerging Tech | Ex PM@Meesho, Consultant@BCG, SWE@Microsoft**

I am a Product Manager with a track record of taking 0-to-1 products to PMF and scaling them in high-velocity, ambiguous environments. I launched and scaled Meesho's experimental fintech charter to ₹1Bn in disbursals. I am a hands-on builder with software development experience and a strong curiosity for emerging technologies and human-computer interaction. Currently exploring AI and agentic workflows through complex projects focused on next-generation user experiences using AI.
